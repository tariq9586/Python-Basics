        "  >Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
        "\n",
        "  >Python is popular for:\n",
        "    >>1. Easy to read and understand :Python has clean, English-like syntax    that makes it easy to write and read code.\n",
        "    >>2. Interpreted Language :Python code runs line-by-line, which simplifies debugging and testing.\n",
        "    >>3. Object-Oriented Programming Language: Supports OOP principles like classes and inheritance for modular, reusable code.\n",
        "    >>4. Free and open Source : Python is freely available for use, and its source code can be modified and shared.\n",
        "    >>5. Versatile and Extensible :Can be used in web, AI, data science, games, and extended with C/C++ code.\n",
        "    >>6. Multi-platform : Works across all major OS like Windows, macOS, and Linux without code changes.\n",
        "    >>7. Hundreds of Libraries and Frameworks : Offers powerful libraries like NumPy, Django, TensorFlow for faster development.\n",
        "    >>8. Huge and Active Community: Millions of users contribute tutorials, tools, and support for learners and developers.\n",

        "  >Interpreters are the computer program that will convert the source code or an high level language into intermediate code (machine level language). It is also called translator in programming terminology. Interpreters executes each line of statements slowly. This process is called Interpretation.\n",

        "  >An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes code line-by-line rather than compiling the entire code at once.\n",

        "\n",
        "  > Key Points:\n",
